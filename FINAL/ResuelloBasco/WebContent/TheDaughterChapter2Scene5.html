<h1>The Daughter</h1>
<h2> Chapter II:<br> "The Suffering"
</h2>
<h3>So the girl became a scullery maid in the large house. All day long she would scrub and clean. 
<br>At night she would go to sleep in a little corner of the kitchen.
The girl would never take her cloak of rushes off, not even at night. 
<br>If someone asked her name, she wouldn't answer. So, since she wouldn't give a name and she wouldn't take her hood and cloak of rushes off, 
<br>the other maids began calling her Cap o' Rushes.
