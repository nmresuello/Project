<br>The guests sat down to eat, but could not swallow a single bite - the saltless food tasted so terrible!
Suddenly, Cap o' Rushes' father burst out crying.<br> 'What is the matter?' asked the others.
'I once had a daughter, who said she loved me as much as food loved salt,' he wept. <br>'I didn't understand what she meant, and threw her out of the house.
 Now, eating this food without salt, I realize she loved me very much!'
<br>Then Cap o' Rushes stood up and put her arms around her father. 'Here I am, Father,' she said. 'Your very own daughter!'
 Her father was overjoyed to see her safe and sound.
