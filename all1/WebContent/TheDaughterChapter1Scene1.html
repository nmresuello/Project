<p><font size="6">Long long time ago, there lived a rich man and his three daughters.<br>
One day, the rich man asked his daughters<br>
One day, the rich man asked his daughters, 'How much do you love me, my dears?'<br>
'Why, Father,' said the first daughter, ' I love you as much as life itself.'<br>
'Oh, Father,' said the second daughter, 'I love you more than the entire world.'<br>
The rich man was very pleased. Then he turned to his youngest daughter, and asked, <br>'And how much do you love me, my little one?'
<br>'I love you as much as food loves salt, Father,' she replied, quietly.
